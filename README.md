## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt any file (text, image, video, etc.)
- Decrypt previously encrypted files
- Auto-generate secure encryption keys
- Simple command-line interface
- Based on Fernet symmetric encryption

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `cryptography` module

Install required module:
```bash
pip install cryptography
